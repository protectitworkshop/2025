                <h2>Scope</h2>
                <p>Protect-IT targets to attract studies on security and privacy for machine learning (ML) from an information-theoretic standpoint. Accuracy and efficiency of ML systems are ensured by employing large datasets which usually contain highly sensitive/personal information. This strong dependence on personal information jeopardizes the privacy and security of innocent Internet users who are contributing, knowingly or not, to these online statistical datasets. Protect-IT aims to bring the typical attendees of CSF, who have expertise on the theory of cryptography and (algorithmic) fairness together with researchers on information theory to study, develop, and evaluate privacy, security, and fairness attacks against ML along with defense strategies to counter them. We put information theory at the heart of this endeavor and call for contributions grounded in information-theoretic concepts and principles, aiming to enrich preliminary research efforts and to achieve widespread adoption.</p>

                                    This talk will discuss a line of work on Shifted Divergences, a notion of distance between distributions over real vectors that is regularized by optimal transport. I will show two applications of this concept, one to differential privacy, and one to rapid mixing.

                                    The first result shows a tight privacy analysis of the noisy SGD algorithm and its variants for smooth convex loss function functions. We show that the privacy cost of the algorithm, that grows initially with the number of iterations, plateaus after a certain number of steps.

                                    The second result studies the convergence of the Langevin Monte Carlo algorithm, a classical algorithm for sampling from a log concave distribution. We give a tight bound on the mixing time of the (discretized) Langevin algorithm to its stationary distribution, in various measures of distance.

                                    No differential privacy background will be assumed. Based on joint works with Jason Altschuler, Vitaly Feldman, Ilya Mironov and Abhradeep Thakurta.

I will focus on a handful of simple, yet quite powerful ideas which, as the title of the talk suggests, go a long way in obtaining private and sample-optimal testing algorithms in a variety of settings.

                                    We will discuss the accuracy of differentially private mechanisms in the continual release model. A continual release mechanism receives a sensitive dataset as a stream of $T$ inputs and produces, after receiving each input, an output that is accurate for all the inputs received so far.
                                    In contrast, a batch algorithm receives the data as one batch and produces a single output.

                                    We provide the first strong lower bounds on the error of continual release mechanisms. In particular, for two fundamental problems that are widely studied and used in the batch model, we prove that the worst case error of every continual release algorithm is $\tilde \Omega(T^{1/3})$ times larger than that of the best batch algorithm. Previous work shows only a polylogarithimic (in $T$) gap between the worst case error achievable in these two models; further, for many problems, including the summation of binary attributes, the polylogarithmic gap is tight (Dwork et al., 2010; Chan et al., 2010). Our results show that  problems closely related to summation---specifically, those that require selecting the largest of a set of sums---are fundamentally harder in the continual release model than in the batch model.

                                    Our lower bounds assume only that privacy holds for streams fixed in advance (the "nonadaptive" setting). We also formulate a model that allows for adaptively selected inputs and prove the privacy of several algorithms in that model. In particular we show that our lower bounds are matched by the error of simple algorithms whose privacy holds even for adaptively selected streams. The adaptive model captures dependencies that arise in many applications of continual release.

                                    Secure computation is a powerful cryptographic primitive, enabling two or more parties to perform joint computations on their secret inputs without revealing the inputs to each other. An appealing application domain is privacy-preserving machine learning, where secure computation is helpful for training and classification tasks involving sensitive data.

                                    Secure computation is known to be generally possible, under standard cryptographic assumptions, since the 1980s. Unfortunately, security does not come for free. In this talk I will survey some recent techniques for minimizing the overhead of secure computation, along with remaining challenges and open problems.
